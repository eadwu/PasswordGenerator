The generator function generates a key that is formed by getting the ASCII equivalent of each letter in the URL and concatenating them.

Within the function, the cipher process uses a variable unique to each letter in the URL (position of the letter in the string) and uses it so that repeating letters will have a lower chance of generating the same cipher-text.
