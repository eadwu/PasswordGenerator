The function for the password generator generates a unique password as no two urls are the same.

So this way the keys of each website will be different.

The conversion of the website's hostname to ASCII generates a unique key.

Repeating letters in the hostname will not always generate the same character as the equation used for the ciphering uses a number unique
to each character in the string (position of the character in the string).
